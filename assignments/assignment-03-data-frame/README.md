# Assignment 03 – Data Frames

## Description
This assignment was based on polling data from the 2016 election. The task was to compute per-candidate averages across two polls and calculate the overall mean across all candidate–poll cells.

To implement this in R, we used a data frame, a fundamental data structure for storing tabular data, where information is organized into rows and columns.

## How to Run
1) Open the project based on the R assignments in RStudio
2) Run all lines (or source the script)
3) Outputs (plots/tables) are produced in the console and/or saved to results/ if applicable.

## Packages - NA
## Data - Source: <link or brief description> - Location: <path if local, or URL if remote>
## Notes: Any assumptions, limitations, or known issues.
