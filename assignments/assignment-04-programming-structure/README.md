Assignment 03 – Data Frames
Description
This assignment was based on polling data from the 2016 election. The task was to compute per-candidate averages across two polls and calculate the overall mean across all candidate–poll cells.

To implement this in R, we used a data frame, a fundamental data structure for storing tabular data, where information is organized into rows and columns.

How to Run
Open the project based on the R assignments in RStudio
Run all lines (or source the script)
Outputs (plots/tables) are produced in the console and/or saved to results/ if applicable.
Packages - NA
Data - Source: - Location: <path if local, or URL if remote>
Notes: Any assumptions, limitations, or known issues.
